      This is computed by the kernel during a restore, but is zeroed out during a normal boot. It is also computed by
      the Secure Bootloader, and its only known use is to decrypt LLB in NOR. Like `0x835`, it is different
      for each device.

      It is used as the encryption key for IMG2 files. With the introduction of IMG3 in iPhone OS 2.0, KBAGs are now
      used instead of the `0x837` key. Because iPhone OS versions 1.x were used only on the iPhone and iPod touch
      (both use the S5L8900) the encrypted values for other processors don't matter.

    description: |
      Another UID-AES-key-based key, it is used to encrypt everything but LLB in the NOR (iBoot,
      DeviceTree, pictures).

    data: 0xDB1F5B33606C5F1C1934AA66589C0661
    description: |
      Used on A4 devices. A device-specific key. It is used to encrypt the SHSH blobs on the device.

    type: uid
    data: 0x183E99676BB03C546FA468F51C0CBD49

      It is used to encrypt the data partition key.
  0x8A3:
    type: uid
    mode: AES-256-CBC
    data: 0x568241656551e0cdf56ff84cc11a79ef
    description: |
      It is used during software upgrades on A12 and later to encrypt the "generator" value (using AES-128-CBC)
      before hashing it to become the nonce.
